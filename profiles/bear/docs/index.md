#Bear Starter Kit

[Bear](https://www.drupal.org/project/bear) is a Drupal Installation Profile Starter Kit to be used as an alternative to Minimal or Standard when installing a Drupal 7 or Drupal 8 website. 

Bear contains many enhancements over the Standard Drupal installation profile by enabling helpful modules and default settings, including 3rd party libraries, and including a base theme to enable building Drupal websites faster.
